/// \file
/// This file implements the AVRDecomposeHIR Pass. This pass decomposes any
/// AVRValueHIR node that encapsulates non-unitary HIR CanonExprs. The result of
/// the decomposition is an AVRExpression tree that explicitly represents each
/// unitary operation/operand in the CanonExpr. A CanonExpr is said unitary if
/// it represents a single temp (%t) or constant (5) operand without any
/// implicit or explicit operation on it. A CanonExpr representing a nested
/// blob, memory operation, non-standalone IV, hidden data type conversion, or
/// any kind or arithmetic or logical operation is considered non-unitary and,
/// thus, subject to be decomposed.
///
/// The decomposition process creates the following kind of nodes:
///    - AVRValueHIR nodes for operands that have HIR-specific representation
///    (blobs and IVs). The HIR information is available from the DDRef
///    (BlobDDRef) or IVValueInfo members of the new AVRValueHIR.
///    - AVRValue nodes for Constant operands. They do not have HIR-specific
///    representation.
///    - AVRExpression nodes for any kind of implicit/explicit operation. They
///    do not have HIR-specific representation.
///
/// After the decomposition, the resulting AVRExpression is accessible from the
/// DecompTree member of the original AVRValueHIR that has been decomposed. The
/// original AVRValueHIR is not replaced or removed from the AVR in order not to
/// penalize the performance of those AVR-based analysis/transformations that do
/// not need decomposed AVRValueHIR nodes. These passes can process the original
/// AVRValueHIR node and ignore the decomposed AVRExpression tree. Algorithms
/// that do need decomposition can access the decomposed AVRExpression on demand
/// using the DecompTree member.
///
/// Rational:
/// ---------
/// This approach is an attempt to minimize the differences in the vectorizer
/// representation when the AVR is built from LLVM-IR and HIR. The main goal is
/// to reduce as much as possible the IR-specific code of vectorizer
/// analyses/transformations that currently is leading to implementing and
/// maintaining two versions of each AVR-based analysis/transformation. The
/// problem and potential solutions were presented and discussed in 7/12/2016
/// US/IDP LLVM Vectorizer Team meeting.
/// More information can be found in
/// S:\cmplr\HPO\Vectorizer\LLVM\AVRValueHIR_issue.pptx
//
/// Usage:
/// ------
/// The decomposition of AVRValueHIR nodes has been designed to be as
/// transparent as possible to clients. AVRVisitor has been extended to
/// automatically traverse the decomposed AVRExpression of those AVRValuesHIR
/// that have been decomposed. This traversal can be enabled or disabled on
/// demand in AVRVisitor with the new flag RecurseInsideValues. If
/// RecurseInsideValues is false, AVRVisitor will not traverse the decomposed
/// AVRExpression of AVRValueHIRs. If it is true, AVRVisitor will first visit
/// the original AVRValueHIR, and then the decomposed AVRExpression. The
/// equivalent behavior applies to post visits.
///
/// Extensions:
/// -----------
/// If clients need a more sophisticated traversal, we can extend the AVRVisitor
/// interface.
///
/// Example 1: some analyses like cost model may want to skip the visit of the
/// original AVRValueHIR and visit only the decomposed AVRExpression. We could
/// support this behavior with a new flag (SkipWrapperValue) in AVRVisitor. A
/// bit mask that represents different behaviors is another option.
///
/// Example 2: some transformation like code gen may want to visit only the
/// decomposed AVRExpression of some particular AVRValueHIR. For example, only
/// AVRValueHIR containing nested blobs. If this is the case, we could add a
/// functor to the interface that would be used as predicate to determine if the
/// decomposed AVRExpression has to be visited or not.
