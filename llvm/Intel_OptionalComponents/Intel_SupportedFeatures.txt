# This file contains a list of features that are supported by the compiler
# build system, i.e. you may pass these features via LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES cmake
# variable.  Read more details in 'Xmain Development Processes' document.
#
# Each feature name must be on a new line and must not contain any blank
# symbols.
#
# TODO (vzakhari 11/1/2018): we may come up with some markup in this file
#                            that would make some of the features, declared
#                            here, "public", meaning that their implementation
#                            can be merged from the "safe" repo to "shared"
#                            repo.  This will require changing the processing
#                            of this file in llvm/CMakeLists.txt.  The tools
#                            making merges from "safe" to "shared" repo, then
#                            will be able to use this file for classifying
#                            the merged code.

# New ISA features usually use ISA_ prefix, e.g. ISA_VNNI.
# === New ISA features section begin ===
# === New ISA features section end ===

# Support for a new target is usually covered by a feature named after
# the target name, e.g. NIOS.
# === New targets section begin ===
# === New targets section end ===

# Software features that need to be kept in the "safe" repo use SW_ prefix,
# e.g. SW_G2S.
# === New SW features section begin ===
# === New SW features section end ===
