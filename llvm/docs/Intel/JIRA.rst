LLVM Specific JIRA Policies
===========================

The Intel LLVM development process documentation is currently under review. If
anything looks wrong to you, please contact `ICL Process Team
<mailto:ICLProcessTeam@intel.com>`_.

Introduction
============

The LLVM projects are governed by the same JIRA usage rules that govern
other Intel Compiler projects. These rules are documented on the process pages.
However, there are a few details covered in this document that only apply to
the LLVM projects.

LLVM projects are identified in JIRA by "Affected Project = Compiler-LLVM".
The Compiler-LLVM project applies to both xmain and llorg.

Project Versions
================

Just as we have different project versions for the mainline and each product
branch of icc, we have different project versions for the mainline and each
product branch of xmain. As of this writing, there are Compiler-LLVM 2016.0
and 2018.0 project versions for the 2016 and 2018 MCU product branches. And
there is a Compiler-LLVM 2019.0 project version for the xmain mainline.

Compiler-LLVM llvm.org is a special project version that represents open source
trunk. We ultimately do not have full control over whether a particular fix
will be committed to llvm.org, but we use JIRA to capture our intent.

Use these project versions to set the "Project Version",
"Impacted Project Version", "Targeted Project Version", and
"Verified in Project Version" fields.
