Introduction
============

The CSA backend and OpenMP target plugin allow users to compile C, C++, and
Fortran code to run on CSA. Usage of CSA compiler features is documented
elsewhere; these pages cover the implementation of those features and how they
fit together to allow compilation for CSA.

Pass Overview
=============

The following is an overview of CSA-specific passes and where they fit into the
general compilation flow:

- Frontend
- CSA Builtin Lowering (CSAFortranIntrinsics, CSALoopIntrinsicExpander) - Lowers
  user-facing pathfinding builtins into common/internal forms.
- Generic IR optimizations + LoopSPMDization
- Late CSA IR passes (CSAIRReductionOpt, StructurizeCFG, CSAInnerLoopPrep,
  CSAStreamingMemoryPrep, CSAIntrinsicCleaner) - These perform extra
  CSA-advantaged optimizations and prepare the code for instruction selection.
- Instruction Selection + CSAExpandInlineAsm
- CSA Memory Operation Ordering (CSAMemopOrdering) - Inserts ordering edges
  between memory operations as needed to enforce memory ordering constraints in
  the original program.
- CSA Dataflow Conversion (CSACvtCFDFPass) - Converts the code from SSA form
  into dataflow by converting branches/phis into picks and switches.
- CSA Dataflow Optimizations:

  - CSAOptDFPass - Optimizes dataflow loops using CSA sequence instructions.
  - CSADataflowCanonicalization - Simplifies dataflow code into canonical forms.
  - CSAStreamingMemoryConversion - Converts strided memory accesses into CSA
    streaming memory operations.
  - CSAMultiSeq - Adds redundant sequence operations to avoid backpressure
    issues.
  - CSARedundantMovElim, CSADeadInstructionElim - Dataflow-aware DCE and simple
    value propagation.
  - CSAProcedureCalls - Converts functions from their initial SXU-based calling
    conventions to dataflow calling conventions.
  - CSAReassocReduc - If enabled, expands reduction operations to increase
    throughput via reassociation.

- Register Allocation + CSANormalizeDebugPass - Register allocation is still
  needed for SXU registers if dataflow calls are disabled, but is a no-op for
  lics. CSANormalizeDebugPass is a small pass that runs beforehand to make sure
  that there aren't disconnected lics hanging around as a result of debug
  values.
- Assembly Printing

Passes before instruction selection operate on standard LLVM IR and many of the
CSA-specific ones exist mostly to manipulate intrinsics used by backend passes
later on. Memory ordering operates on "standard" SSA Machine IR but passes
starting with dataflow conversion operate on Machine IR interpreted as dataflow
code. See "CSA Dataflow Machine Code Representation" (TODO: replace with link)
for more information on this format and how to use it.

Usage Models
============

There are several different ways of compiling for CSA:

Manual Offload / Separate Compilation
  C and C++ code can be compiled directly for CSA with ``-target csa`` and run
  directly using the simulator API defined in csa_invoke.h. This is the simplest
  way of invoking the compiler and often the most useful for compiler work.

Compiler Offload / OpenMP Offload
  C and C++ code can be compiled with ``-fopenmp-targets=csa`` and regions
  marked with ``#pragma omp target`` will automatically be run through the
  compilation flow above at compile time and then automatically invoked using
  the simulator at runtime. This is the easiest way to run existing code on CSA
  and will be the primary usage model in the long term.

Fortran
  Until the Intel Fortran frontend is mature enough for external use, we are
  using a temporary workaround where code is compiled into IR using gfortran
  with the DragonEgg plugin and then run through the rest of the standard
  compilation flow. This is not as stable or well-tested as the other usage
  models, but customers have had moderate success using it with a couple of
  Fortran workloads.

[ TODO: Compiler Offload and DragonEgg may warrant separate pages describing all
of their details - add links in this section when those are available. ]
