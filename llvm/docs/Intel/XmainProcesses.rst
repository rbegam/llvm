Xmain Development Processes

Introduction
============

This document describes our processes for code development in xmain. There is a
separate :doc:`document <OpenSourceProcesses>` describing our processes for open
source LLVM/clang code development.

The xmain project stays in sync with open source via our
:doc:`pulldown process <PulldownProcess>`.
xmain typically stays within several months of open source trunk. Consequently,
changes that are committed directly to open source usually do **not** need to
be ported to xmain by the developer. The exception is when the changes are
urgently needed in xmain to meet a deadline or to unblock other xmain
development. In these exceptional cases, developers should follow all the
xmain development processes, including the use of
:ref:`Intel-specific code markups <xmain-markups>`.

Developing on a Component Branch
================================

Individual components are free to define their own processes for committing to
the component branch. Those processes may be different from the xmain processes
documented here, but the xmain processes are enforced when the component branch
is promoted to xmain trunk.

Component groups are free to create additional pages here describing their
component-specific processes.

Xmain Gatekeeping
=================

All commits to the xmain trunk must be approved by an xmain gatekeeper, whose
job it is to watch for potential conflicts and ensure that all processes are
followed.

Before requesting gatekeeper review, please go through the following checklist
to ensure that your changes are ready for submission. Gatekeepers will also use
this checklist when evaluating change sets.

#. Make sure your changes are consistent with our
   :doc:`Open Source Decision Making Process <OpenSourceGuidelines>`. We prefer
   to upstream changes where possible to avoid having to maintain unnecessary
   customizations in xmain.
#. Make sure all changes to community files are
   :ref:`properly marked <xmain-markups>` as Intel customizations.
#. Make sure behavioral changes in the compiler are adequately covered by
   :ref:`unit tests <unit-testing>`.
#. Conduct a :ref:`code review <code-reviews>` using Gerrit and get +1 approval
   from someone who has taken the time to thoroughly understand your changes.
#. Run an appropriate amount of
   :ref:`pre-commit testing <testing-requirements>`, and attach the test
   results to the Gerrit review. We recommend that you use the integrated alloy
   testing feature of Gerrit to do this. Any expected failures must be captured
   in JIRA, and the Gerrit review must contain a clear explanation for why the
   change should be approved for xmain in spite of the failures.

The next step depends on whether you are submitting an individual change set or
a branch promotion.

For individual change sets, the gatekeeping process is integrated into
`Gerrit <https://git-amr-2.devtools.intel.com/gerrit>`_. Simply add
``xmain gatekeeper`` as you would a normal code reviewer. The current
gatekeepers will be notified and will review your change set for xmain
readiness. Gatekeepers may ask questions, request additional changes, request
additional testing, etc. Once satisfied, a gatekeeper will give +2 and
then you may submit your changes to xmain. Changes might need to be rebased
before submission. If your changes rebase cleanly, you still have permission to
submit your changes, but you will need to reinstate the code review +2 if
Gerrit cleared it. If there are conflicts during rebase, you will need to
resolve them and upload a new change set for further review. The amount of
testing of the new change set is at your discretion but requires agreement
from the gatekeeper.

    The following paragraph provides a link that automatically opens up an email
    with the xmain checkin request form. It is not very human-readable, because
    spaces and other special characters are replaced by hex directives, e.g.
    %20. We should change this if there is a more human-readable form that
    achieves the same functionality.

For branch promotions, gatekeeping is done via email. When a developer is ready
to commit a change, the `xmain checkin request form

.. _xmain-markups:

Marking Intel-specific Code in Xmain
====================================

**Every** Intel-specific change to Xmain needs to be marked as such in the
source. This makes it easier for the people merging with the community sources
to do the right thing. There are several acceptable ways to mark Intel-specific
code changes. When choosing a method for marking your code, the most important
consideration is clarity & readability.

- For multi-line additions, the preferred method is to enclose the
  Intel-specific code like this.

.. code-block:: c++

  #if INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
    // Optimize the size of ICmp and eliminate unnecessary instructions.
    if (Instruction *R = OptimizeICmpInstSize(I, Op0, Op1))
      return R;
  #endif // INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

- Multi-line modifications may be marked in the same way. There is no need to
  retain the original unmodified community code as that would usually degrade
  clarity. As such, ``#if INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION`` directives should rarely, if
  ever, have an accompanying ``#else``. Here is an example of proper usage.

.. We cannot format this block as c++ due to the diff markers.
.. code-block:: text

  -  // If there is a trivial two-entry PHI node in this basic block, and we can
  -  // eliminate it, do so now.
  -  if (PHINode *PN = dyn_cast<PHINode>(BB->begin()))
  -    if (PN->getNumIncomingValues() == 2)
  -      Changed |= FoldTwoEntryPHINode(PN, TTI, DL);
  +#if INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
  +  // If there is a PHI node in this basic block, and we can
  +  // eliminate some of its entries, do so now.
  +  if (PHINode *PN = dyn_cast<PHINode>(BB->begin())) {
  +    // FoldPHIEntries is an Intel customized generalized version of the LLVM
  +    // open source routine called FoldTwoEntryPHINode(that folds a two-entry
  +    // phinode into "select") which is capable of handling any number
  +    // of phi entries. It iteratively transforms each conditional into
  +    // "select". Any changes (one such change could be regarding cost model)
  +    // made by the LLVM community to FoldTwoEntryPHINode will need to be
  +    // incorporated to this routine (FoldPHIEntries).
  +    // To keep xmain as clean as possible we got rid of the FoldTwoEntryPHINode,
  +    // therefore, there might be conflicts during code merge. If resolving
  +    // conflicts becomes too cumbersome, we can try something different.
  +    Changed |= FoldPHIEntries(PN, TTI, DL);
  +  }
  +#endif

- Some files, e.g. CMakeLists.txt, are not run through the preprocessor.
  Use # INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION, # end INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION pair. In situations
  where # INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION does not work, e.g. tablegen (.td), additions
  should be enclosed in comments like this.

.. code-block:: c++

  // INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
  // X86_RegCall return-value convention.
  multiclass RetCC_X86_RegCall<RC_X86_RegCall RC, CallingConv CC> :
    X86_RegCall_base<RC, CC>;

  defm RetCC_X86_32_RegCall :
       RetCC_X86_RegCall<RC_X86_32_RegCall, RetCC_X86Common>;
  defm RetCC_X86_64_RegCall_Win :
       RetCC_X86_RegCall<RC_X86_64_RegCall_Win, RetCC_X86_Win64_C>;
  defm RetCC_X86_64_RegCall_Lin :
       RetCC_X86_RegCall<RC_X86_64_RegCall_Lin, RetCC_X86Common>;
  // end INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

- For small additions or modifications, it is often clearer to add a comment at
  the end of **each** modified line like this.

.. code-block:: c++

  Inliner::Inliner(char &ID, bool InsertLifetime)
      : CallGraphSCCPass(ID), InsertLifetime(InsertLifetime), // INTEL
        Report(IntelInlineReportLevel) {}                     // INTEL

- Pure deletions should be excluded with an explanatory comment like this.

.. code-block:: c++

  #if !INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
      // This code isn't needed with the Intel customizations, because we always
      // run the SSAUpdater to resolve cross-BB references.
      // Remap the value if necessary.
      if (Instruction *Inst = dyn_cast<Instruction>(IV)) {
        DenseMap<Instruction*, Value*>::iterator I = ValueMap.find(Inst);
        if (I != ValueMap.end())
          IV = I->second;
      }
  #endif // !INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

- For Intel-added files, you do not need to put any special markups in the
  sources. Instead, the fully qualified file name should contain ``Intel``
  or ``intel``. Intel-added files should be headed by an Intel copyright
  notice, not by the typical LLVM one. The following is a sample that you can
  adapt by changing the filename, file description, and copyright dates
  appropriately.

.. code-block:: c++

  //==--- Intel_Directives.cpp - Table of directives and clauses -*- C++ -*---==//
  //
  // Copyright (C) 2015-2017 Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.
  //
  // The information and source code contained herein is the exclusive property
  // of Intel Corporation and may not be disclosed, examined or reproduced in
  // whole or in part without explicit written authorization from the company.
  //
  // ===--------------------------------------------------------------------=== //

- For code which should be excluded from final release builds but included
  in 'prod' builds during development (such as IR printing capabilities),
  you should use the 'INTEL_PRODUCT_RELEASE' preprocessor symbol.  This
  symbol will be defined only for 'release' builds when ics usage is set to
  qa mode (using 'ics set usage qa').  For example:

.. code-block:: c++

  void MyClass::print(raw_ostream &OS) const {
  #if !INTEL_PRODUCT_RELEASE
    // Print the IR for MyClass to OS.
    OS << MyClass.A << "\n";
  #endif // !INTEL_PRODUCT_RELEASE
  }

..

  This preprocessor symbol should be used the same in either modified LLVM
  files or Intel-specific source files.

Guarding Intel Proprietary Features in Xmain
============================================

``Customized compiler builds``
------------------------------

This section describes development practices that allow producing customized
compiler builds from the common source base.  Development of some SW features
and early support of HW features may require build time controls, so that
Intel secret features are not exposed in product compiler builds.

We use CMake list variable 'LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES' to hold a list of features
enabled for a particular compiler build.  Additional features may be enabled
via ICS build command option:

.. code-block:: console

  ics build FEATURES="AVX3_1,AVX3_2"

.. note:: Feature names may only consist of symbols that are valid for C/C++ identifiers.

.. note:: During the initial run of `ics build`, the list of features is fixed
          in CMake configuration, so any changes in the `FEATURES="..."` list
          in the consequent `ics build` commands will not take effect.
          To build a compiler with new list of features, please, build it
          from scratch.

'LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES' may be used for conditional CMake processing.  For example,
we have the following code in `llvm/CMakeLists.txt`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  foreach(f ${LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES})
    string(CONCAT FOPT "-DINTEL_FEATURE_" ${f} "=1")
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${FOPT}")
  endforeach(f)

This code populates C++ compilation flags with options like '-DINTEL_FEATURE_XXX=1'
based on the list of features provided in 'LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES' list.

.. note:: We do not currently update CMAKE_C_FLAGS, so pure C files are compiled
          without any INTEL_FEATURE\_ macros enabled.

To guard Intel secret features in C/C++ files use feature checks in addition to
'INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION' checks, e.g.:

.. code-block:: c++

  #if INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
  #if INTEL_FEATURE_AVX3_2
  // AVX3_2 specific code.
  #endif // INTEL_FEATURE_AVX3_2
  #endif // INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

To completely exclude a C/C++ file from compilation, when some feature is not
enabled, we can use conditional processing of CMake files.  In the following
example in `llvm/lib/CodeGen/CMakeLists.txt` we conditionally add `Intel_Avx3_2.cpp`
file to compilation only if AVX3_2 feature is enabled:

.. _conditional-comp:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
  set(INTEL_SOURCE_FILES
    Intel_MachineLoopOptReportEmitter.cpp
    )
  set(INTEL_AVX3_2_SOURCE_FILES
    Intel_Avx3_2.cpp
    )
  set(INTEL_SOURCE_FILES_TO_BUILD)
  if (INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION)
    if(";${LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES};" MATCHES ";AVX3_2;")
      list(APPEND INTEL_SOURCE_FILES ${INTEL_AVX3_2_SOURCE_FILES})
    else()
      list(APPEND LLVM_OPTIONAL_SOURCES ${INTEL_AVX3_2_SOURCE_FILES})
    endif()
    set(INTEL_SOURCE_FILES_TO_BUILD ${INTEL_SOURCE_FILES})
  else()
    list(APPEND LLVM_OPTIONAL_SOURCES ${INTEL_SOURCE_FILES} ${INTEL_AVX3_2_SOURCE_FILES})
  endif(INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION)
  # end INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

  add_llvm_library(LLVMCodeGen
  # INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
    ${INTEL_SOURCE_FILES_TO_BUILD}
  # end INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
    ...
    )

.. note:: LLVM_OPTIONAL_SOURCES variable helps to avoid build errors for files
          that are not used during build but are present in the source tree.

C/C++ preprocessor is not run for files of other types, so we have to use
different techniques to conditionally compile them.

One of the most often changes in `LLVMBuild.txt` files is adding dependencies
to some Intel proprietary LLVM component libraries.  `LLVMBuild.txt` also do not
support inline comments, so we used to put INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION comments on
separate lines - this complicated merges for these files a little bit.

An alternative solution is to add LLVM component libraries dependencies
in CMakeLists.txt.  For example, instead of having the following code
in `llvm/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LLVMBuild.txt`:

.. code-block:: text

  [component_0]
  type = Library
  name = Scalar
  parent = Transforms
  library_name = ScalarOpts
  required_libraries = AggressiveInstCombine Analysis Core InstCombine Support TransformUtils Intel_OptReport
  ; ***INTEL: Intel_OptReport

We may have the following in `llvm/lib/Transforms/Scalar/CMakeLists.txt`:

.. _lib-dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

  # INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION
  target_link_libraries(LLVMScalarOpts PRIVATE LLVMIntel_OptReport)
  # end INTEL_CUSTOMIZATION

It is obvious how the LLVM component library dependence may be added
in a CMakeLists.txt based, for example, on LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES.
The only caveat is: if an Intel proprietary LLVM component library is not
used in some compiler build, this build will complain about an unused library
not being marked as `optional`.  In this case, we should mark this library
as `optional` using the following `LLVMBuild.txt` syntax:

.. _optional-lib:

.. code-block:: text

  [component_0]
  type = OptionalLibrary
  name = Intel_Avx3_2ScalarOpt
  ...

.. note:: Otherwise, we do not currently support any sort of preprocessing
          of LLVMBuild.txt files during the compiler build.

Conditional processing of tablegen (.td) files is not currently supported,
but we have agreed on the following direction:

- We will support simple preprocessor syntax, such as:

.. code-block:: c++

  // INTEL_FEATURE_AVX3_2
  // AVX3_2 specific code.
  // end INTEL_FEATURE_AVX3_2

- A special Intel tool will be called from `llvm/cmake/modules/TableGen.cmake`
  (and, maybe, other cmake scripts) to preprocess a .td file into a temporary
  .td file before passing it to the tablegen.

- The preprocessing will only work for .td files participating in tablegen()
  commands in `CMakeLists.txt` files, i.e. preprocessing will not work
  for "included" .td files.

.. note:: TODO: update this text, when the preprocessing tool is ready and
          plugged into the build process.

``Source code isolation``
-------------------------

There may be cases, when some parts of the source code must be isolated
into a separate directory with its own access rights.  For example,
the compiler team is developing a secret feature, which cannot be exposed
in any way to other teams that have access to xmain repository.
The approved solution for this is to put such source code into a subdirectory
of `llvm/Intel_OptionalComponents` and plug in things from this subdirectory
during the compiler build using LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES controls.

If implementation of a feature may done as a LLVM component library, then
this library must be declared as :ref:`optional <optional-lib>` and it may
be optionally :ref:`linked <lib-dependencies>` to some existing LLVM component
library to extend its functionality.

In most cases, we will have to have source code references to the isolated
feature implmenentation, e.g. to C/C++ header files containing common
interfaces.  This may be done by setting include directories for the compiler
build in `llvm/CMakeLists.txt`:

.. code-block:: cmake

  if (";${LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES};" MATCHES ";AVX3_2;")
    set(INTEL_ANY_OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS TRUE)
    set(INTEL_AVX3_2_INCLUDE_DIR ${LLVM_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/Intel_OptionalComponents/AVX3_2/include)
    include_directories(AFTER ${INTEL_AVX3_2_INCLUDE_DIR})
    SET(LLVMOPTIONALCOMPONENTS ${LLVMOPTIONALCOMPONENTS} Intel_Avx3_2ScalarOpt)
  endif()

This code allows using flat C/C++ include paths for header files located
in `llvm/Intel_OptionalComponents/AVX3_2/include`.  Such include directives
obviously need to be guarded with the corresponding INTEL_FEATURE_AVX3_2
macro check.

The same way, C/C++ source files may be conditionally added to the compiler
build using full paths like :ref:`${LLVM_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/Intel_OptionalComponents/\
AVX3_2/lib/Transforms/Intel_Avx3_2.cpp <conditional-comp>`.

Coding Standards
================

Xmain developers are expected to adhere to the same coding standards as open
source developers. Those coding standards are documented
:doc:`here <../CodingStandards>`. The purpose of this policy is provide a
consistent set of coding standards and to make it easier to upstream changes
from xmain when we choose to do so.

We enforce this policy primarily through code reviews. If you notice any
violations, you are encouraged to fix them.

.. _unit-testing:

Unit Test Development
=====================

All functional changes to xmain must be accompanied by unit tests using the
LIT infrastructure. This requirement is no different from what the open source
community expects.

Additionally, new programmer visible features should be accompanied by
end-to-end tests in our ``tc`` test suites. Changes to the test suite are
normally made using the ``TMT`` tool.

All test changes must be code reviewed following the same
:ref:`code review <code-reviews>` processes used for compiler changes. This
includes both LIT changes and ``tc`` test changes.

.. _code-reviews:

Code Reviews
============

Our code review policy requires that every piece of code in xmain is thoroughly
understood and accepted by more than one person. Having a second person read
through your code and attempt to understand it helps identify pieces that are
confusing, inefficient, or incorrect. Code reviews are a critical mechanism for
ensuring that the code we commit to xmain is of the highest quality.

Code Review Tool
----------------

`Gerrit <https://git-amr-2.devtools.intel.com/gerrit>`_ is the official code
review tool for xmain development. All xmain code reviews should be done
through gerrit.

Choosing a code reviewer
------------------------

If you are unsure who should review your changes, the advice of the LLVM
community documented `here <../Phabricator.html>`_ works just as well for
xmain. That is,

- Use ``git blame`` and the commit log to find names of people who have recently
  modified the same area of code that you are modifying.
- If you've discussed the change with others, they are good candidates to be
  your reviewers.

.. note:: We do not currently have an xmain equivalent of CODE_OWNERS.txt, but
          we are working on creating one. In case this document is out of date,
          check the root llvm directory for intel_code_owners.map or something
          similar.

Expectations of code reviewers
------------------------------

- It is the job of the code reviewer to **thoroughly** understand the code
  changes under review. Reviewers must understand both the high level design
  and the low level details. Every change in xmain must be given a detailed
  line-by-line code review. A cursory reading of the code is not an adequate
  code review. Code reviewers and code authors are equally responsible for the
  quality of code that gets committed to xmain.

- Reviews should be timely. At this time, we do not have a specific rule for
  how long a review should take. But remember that the code reviewer is usually
  on the critical path for getting code committed. So make code reviews a
  priority!

- For important issues that you find, e.g. correctness or efficiency problems,
  insist that the author either fix the problem or convince you that there is
  no problem. Escalate if necessary!

- Defer to the code author on issues that are purely matters of personal
  preference. By all means make suggestions, but give the author the final say.

Expectations of code authors
----------------------------

- First and foremost, be appreciative of the time people take to review your
  code. We are all busy people.

- Make things as easy as possible on your code reviewers, specifically

   - Partition large pieces of work into small, self-contained change sets.

   - Proofread your code before requesting a code review. It is frustrating for
     code reviewers to have to correct your typos, formatting errors, etc.

   - Accompany each code review request with a good explanation of what you are
     trying to accomplish in the change set, providing any necessary context.
     Well-written unit tests are often the best way to establish context for a
     review since they should illustrate what the change set is trying to
     accomplish.

   - Document your code well, either via source comments or via higher level
     documentation in the llvm/docs area.

   - Respond to code review comments in a timely manner so that reviewers don't
     lose their train of thought.

   - Avoid updating your sources in between code review iterations. That makes
     it difficult for reviewers to do incremental reviews. If you **must**
     update your sources, it is helpful to upload a version of your changes
     that **only** reflects the update with no other changes.

.. _testing-requirements:

Testing Requirements
====================

Commits to xmain are expected to meet a minimum level of stability and
performance. Prior to requesting commit permission, developers should run
xmain_checkin for stability testing and zperf_checkin_xmain for performance
testing. The following alloy command is suitable.

::

    alloy run -file xmain_checkin -file zperf_checkin_xmain -ref_comp ws -notify

Of course, good judgment should always prevail. The gatekeeper may choose to
permit less testing for low risk change sets and may choose to require extra
testing for high risk change sets.

Developers can also take advantage of integrated `AlloyGerrit
<http://iclqa.sc.intel.com/BuildBoard/XmainDocs/Intel/XmainAlloyGerrit.html>`_
testing infrastructure.

Expectations Regarding New Stability Failures
---------------------------------------------

All new stability failures must be analyzed and understood. The xmain gatekeeper
will never approve a checkin request with an unanalyzed stability failure,
because without understanding the failure, it is impossible to assess its
impact.

If the developer and gatekeeper agree that a new failure has low impact, the
gatekeeper may approve the checkin in spite of the failure, provided that the
developer first submit a CQ. This commonly occurs when the failure is caused
by an error in the failing test itself.

For new LIT failures, in addition to submitting a CQ, you must mark the test as
an expected failure by adding a line like this.

::

  ; INTEL - This test is marked XFAIL due to cq415116,cq415117. Once those
  ; problems are fixed, we can restore this test to the community version.
  ; XFAIL: *
  ; END INTEL


Expectations Regarding Performance Regressions
----------------------------------------------

All performance regressions need to be justified before the gatekeeper will
approve a checkin request. Unanalyzed regressions are often allowed if they
are small and are accompanied by offsetting improvements in other tests.
Large regressions always need to be analyzed and understood. The gatekeeper
will usually not approve checkin requests involving large performance
regressions, but there may be exceptions in some cases.

The developer must submit a JIRA report for any performance regression that
requires follow-up work before the gatekeeper will approve the checkin request.
